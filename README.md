# How Push is utilised in out Application 

Push notifications are utilized in our Apecoin DAO app in various ways to improve governance and enhance user engagement. Here are some potential use cases which the app focuses on:

1. Proposal submissions: The app could send a push notification to the relevant members of the DAO when a new proposal is submitted, ensuring that they are aware of the proposal and can review it promptly.

2. Voting reminders: The app could send push notifications to users reminding them to vote on pending proposals. This would help ensure that all members have a chance to participate in the decision-making process.

3 .Merchandise updates: Push notifications could be used to inform users about new merchandise products that have been added to the app. This would keep users engaged and encourage them to visit the app more frequently.

4. DAO events: If the Apecoin DAO hosts events, push notifications could be sent to users to inform them of the event details and remind them to attend.

5. Propol status updates: As proposals progress through the voting process, push notifications could be sent to keep users updated on the status of each proposal.
